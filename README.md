# Project-9

## The prior project (workplace-8) is carried out in conjunction with this one.

## Project's main goal


This project's goal is to promote the idea of automating everyday operations in DevOps and use Jenkins, a well-known open source automation server, to automate our Tooling Website's deployment process. The project emphasizes the value of automation in guaranteeing quick and repeatable deployments, particularly when working with lots of servers. As a method of accelerating software development while ensuring code quality, continuous integration (CI) is also presented. Jenkins will be used by the project to automatically build and test code before merging it into the common repository.

## Installation and configuration of Jenkins server
